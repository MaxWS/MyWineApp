Project brief

Title: Wine Reminder App

Introduction: This project is a Web App that allows users to save information about wines they have tried. I designed and develoed the entire project myself. The user can write information about wines such as: name, year, grape variety and comments. This information can be saved in the App and the data is available to the user at any time.
The UI was done using the Framework 'Bootstrap 4', 'Google Fonts' and 'Font Awesome'. The App saves the data in memory using the 'Local Storage' API, to be available to the user at any time. The logic was hardcoded in 'Javascript' and 'JSON'.

Technologies: 
* Bootstrap 4
* Font Awesome 
* Google Fonts 
* Javascript
* JSON
* Local Storage API
